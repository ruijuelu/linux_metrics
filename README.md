# linux_metrics
This project entails the creation of a Bash script to capture and present various system metrics for a Linux operating system. The script provides insights into the Linux version in use, network details including private and public IP addresses as well as the default gateway. It extends to compute disk statistics, showcasing overall size, free, and used space. The script also highlights the five largest directories and monitors CPU usage, updating these statistics every ten seconds to reflect real-time system state.
